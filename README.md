# databricks-apps-volume-helper

This app allows users to browse a volume, view images, PDFs, and also upload files through a web browser. 
This app concept gives non Databricks console users the ability to interact (view, download, upload) with data in Databricks volumes. 
It potentially opens up collaboration with files and Databricks volumes to a wider user group beyond console users.
