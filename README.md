# volume-helper

A file browser utility for Databricks Volumes. 
The volumes files browser in our console does not present a native way to quickly examine documents and images, it only displays files. This app allows users to browse a volume, view images, PDFs, and also upload files through a web browser. 


Enables org and domain users that do not have Databricks console access to collaborate view upload and download files. 
It potentially opens up collaboration with files and Databricks volumes to a wider user group beyond console users.

Example use cases:

- Users across organizations can share files for integration with model development or for analysis

 - Org business users can upload large data exports (CSVs, JSON, XML) to data teams directly into Databricks volumes. Data teams can ingest files and return with a Databricks apps with visualizations embedded for an improved workflow without the need to learn the Databricks console.

- Future workflows can be created to integrate this tool into a self service workflow for visualizations or NLP genie interfaces"

## App resource dependencies

By specifying the UC Volume resource type and resource mapping, the service principal associated with your app will be able to either read or read and write to your volume.
After your app is deployed click Edit.

Within the edit app menu, modify the resource type, volume location, and permissions. If you have not already created a volume and put some files there, now is the time to do that.

## Create a personal access token (PAT)
